# Celestial_Bodies_Database
Build a Celestial Bodies Database
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification. For this project, you will build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.
The project runs in a virtual machine, complete the user stories described in there and get all the tests to pass to finish step 1.
Important: After you pass all the project tests, save a dump of your database into a universe.sql file so you can complete step 2. There will be instructions how to do that within the virtual machine.
